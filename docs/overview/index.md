# Getting Started with AWS

When you’re first learning AWS—especially within the University of Oregon’s environment—there are a few foundational concepts that will help set you up for success:

- **Access & Authentication**  
  Understand how Single Sign-On (SSO) simplifies the login process and how roles within our AWS Organization determine what you can do.

- **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**  
  Permissions in AWS are governed by IAM policies and roles. Knowing how they work ensures you can navigate resources securely and request additional access when needed.

- **Core Services**  
  Familiarize yourself with key AWS offerings like EC2 (compute), S3 (storage), and RDS (databases). Learning the “big three” will give you a solid footing for deploying more advanced solutions later.

- **AWS Console Basics**  
  The AWS Console is your gateway to everything else—discover where to find services, how to switch regions, and best practices for organizing your resources.

- **Cost Awareness & Security**  
  Even with a UO-provided account, it’s crucial to keep an eye on costs, follow tagging practices, and adhere to university policies to maintain a secure and budget-friendly environment.

By grasping these core ideas, you’ll have the confidence to explore AWS and dive deeper into the tools and practices that will make your projects successful. Once you have the basics down, feel free to explore our in-depth guides on specific services, infrastructure as code, and more!
