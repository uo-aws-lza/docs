# Infrastructure-as-Code

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is an approach to managing and provisioning your IT infrastructure—servers, networks, virtual machines, containers, and related components—using machine-readable configuration files. Here’s why you might want to use IaC:

1. **Consistency and Repeatability**
With IaC, you can ensure that the same configuration is used each time you create an environment. This drastically reduces the likelihood of drift (where systems end up in different states due to ad-hoc changes) and makes your infrastructure more predictable.

2. **Version Control and Change Management**
Because IaC is stored as code, every change can be tracked through version control. This allows you to see who changed what and why, and to potentially roll back to a known good state if needed.

3. **Scalability and Automation**
IaC lets you automate the creation and destruction of infrastructure components. This is especially useful in cloud environments, where you might need to quickly spin up and tear down resources based on demand.

4. **Speed of Deployment**
Deploying infrastructure using code drastically speeds up delivery cycles. New environments (for development, testing, or production) can be created in minutes, not days, leading to faster iteration and innovation.

5. **Reduced Risk of Human Error**
Since IaC configurations are standardized and vetted, there’s less manual intervention involved. This minimizes the chances of a misconfiguration caused by manual processes.

By defining your entire infrastructure in code, you gain all of the advantages of modern software development—version control, automated testing, collaboration, and quick rollbacks—applied to infrastructure provisioning and management.
