# Getting to Know Your AWS Account

This guide will walk you through the basics of accessing and familiarizing yourself with your University of Oregon-provided AWS account. Since your account has already been created by the UO Cloud Team, you won’t need to set up any billing or sign-up details. Instead, you’ll focus on logging in, reviewing your permissions, and getting comfortable with the AWS Console.

## Overview

- **Goal**: Learn to log in to your University-provided AWS account, understand your IAM user, and explore the AWS Console.
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - Access to the UO-provided AWS credentials (single sign-on link).
  - A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

## Step 1: Log In to the AWS Console

1. **Navigate to the AWS Console**: 
   - You can log into the AWS Organization using your DuckID at the SSO link here: [awslogin.uoregon.edu](https://awslogin.uoregon.edu)

3. **Select your account (if prompted): 
   - You will be presented with a list of accounts you have access to.
   - Expand the account you want to log into, and click the link related to the level of access you want to have (typically `AdministratorAccess`).

## Step 2: Get Acquainted with the AWS Console Layout

The AWS Console is organized by service. Some of the most commonly used services and features include:

1. **Services Menu**:  
   - Located at the top left (labeled **Recently Visited**). This shows you the recently visited services, and has a button at the bottom to view all services.
   - Browse categories like Compute (EC2, Lambda), Storage (S3), and Databases (RDS, DynamoDB).

2. **Search Bar**:  
   - At the top of the console, use the search bar to quickly find services (e.g., search for “EC2” to launch an instance).

3. **Region Selector**:  
   - Top-right corner (next to your account name). 
   - Choose the AWS Region closest to you. We recommend `us-west-2 (Oregon)`.

4. **Account Menu**:  
   - Top-right corner, click your username. 
   - Access your AWS billing information and other account options.

## Step 3: Explore Key Information in Your Account

1. **Billing & Cost Management** (Optional):  
   - Go to **Billing and Cost Management** in the account menu.
   - This is where you can see how costs are tracked and where to view usage.

2. **Service Limits/Quotas**:  
   - Each AWS service has default quotas (e.g., a limited number of EC2 instances). 
   - You can view quotas in **Service Quotas** to understand the boundaries of your account.

3. **Personalize Your Console**:  
   - Pin frequently used services to the top navigation bar for quick access.
   - Update your **Console Home** dashboard with shortcuts to commonly used services or recently visited resources.

## Step 4: Next Steps

Now that you’ve explored your AWS account, you’re ready to dive deeper into specific services:

- **Check out the [Understanding Basic IAM Policies](#)** guide next to learn how to grant and manage permissions securely.
- Or jump directly to a hands-on task, such as [Launching an EC2 Instance](#).

## Troubleshooting & Support

- If you can’t log in or are missing permissions, submit a Support Request at TODO(link) [Cloud Services Support](https://service.uoregon.edu/cloud-support).
