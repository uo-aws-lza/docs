# University of Oregon Cloud Wiki

Welcome to the University of Oregonâ€™s Cloud Wiki! This wiki is designed to help you get started with public cloud computing, focusing primarily on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Whether you are looking for a quick how-to on launching an EC2 instance or want to adopt Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices using Terraform, this is the place to begin.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Step-by-step guides** for AWS operations (e.g., launching an EC2 instance).
- **Terraform examples** and best practices for automating cloud resource creation.
- **Tips and tricks** for managing your cloud environments efficiently and securely.
- **Reference materials** to help you navigate AWS tooling.

## Who This Is For

These guides are primarily for University of Oregon faculty and staff looking to:

1. Explore AWS services.
2. Learn how to create and manage cloud resources.
3. Implement best practices for security, cost optimization, and automation.
4. Collaborate on cloud projects and share knowledge.

## How to Use This Site

Each guide follows a common structure:

1. **Overview**: Explains the purpose of the task and prerequisites.
2. **Steps**: Provides a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough.
3. **Verification**: Offers suggestions to verify that everything is set up correctly.
4. **Cleanup (if applicable)**: Explains how to terminate or clean up resources to avoid unnecessary costs.

Feel free to jump into any section that interests you. We recommend starting with the [Getting Started with AWS](docs/getting_started/index.md) guide if youâ€™re new to the platform.
